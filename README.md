# Solutions to problems in _An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_
Solutions to problems in the textbook _An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory_ by Michael E. Peskin and Daniel V. Schroeder. The problems are also included in the document. Actually I worked the problems out all by myself, I can't guarantee the correctness. If you found any error, please submit an issue.
